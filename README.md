# Todo App
## TODOs
- ~~Use `evt.target.closest` in events instead of whatever currently is going on.~~
- ~~Make sure the responsibilities are propery seperated.~~
- List incomplete counter
- ~~Completion and importance toggle inside todo detail.~~
- Sliding animations instead of collapsing
- Simple sound effects
- Small effects while completing and starring the TODOs (like YouTube's current like button).
- Groups
- Due dates
- Repetition
- More special lists - today, tasks and completed
- Sharing (as text)
- Import/export
- List customizablilty options - accent color, icon and maybe background image
- Context menu support on mobile
- Look into new sorting stratgey - don't sort everytime; instead, keep a 'rank' propery inside each todo which will be assigned and updated by specific rules (I think this is how MS Todo does it since, after marking an important todo unimportant, it still remains in its place).
- Use IconMoon instead of FontAwesome.
